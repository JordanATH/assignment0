<h3> A bugs life </h3>
<body> 
<marquee> <h5> "What would be left of our tragedies if an insect were to present us his?" - Emil Cioran </h5> </marquee>
<p> In this website I will be speaking about multiple common insects that you can commonly see in your own home, including, but not limitedd to; ants, spiders, cockroaches, and flies. More specifically I'll be detailing their surprisingly short life spans, and what they do during those one or two days. Bugs, more specifically their life cycles have interested me since I was young because of their features that were so distinct from other mammals. That is why I have dedicated my 0'th(?) assignment to them </p>
<p> A bug's life is harsh, the most common being a house fly. You've seen many of these creeper crawlersin your home, but what exactly do they do  </p>
