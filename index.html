<h3> A bugs life </h3>

<marquee> <h5> "What would be left of our tragedies if an insect were to present us his?" - Emil Cioran </h5> </marquee>
<p> In this website I will be speaking about multiple common insects that you can commonly see in your own home, including, but not limitedd to; ants, spiders, cockroaches, and flies. More specifically I'll be detailing their surprisingly short life spans, and what they do during those one or two days. Bugs, more specifically their life cycles have interested me since I was young because of their features that were so distinct from other mammals. That is why I have dedicated my 0'th(?) assignment to them </p>
<p> A bug's life is harsh, the most common being a house fly. You've seen many of these creeper crawlersin your home, but what exactly do they do  </p>

 <p>  Despite their flaws, houseflies are an integral part to the balance of the ecosystem. They balance and break down decaying matter, as well as serving as a food source for frogs and others. Before you recoil in disgust, remember that they play just as important of a role as you do. Maybe a little more, considering the damage humans do to the environment. Houseflies have four stages ranging to egg, larva, pupa, and adult and they often live from about 15 to 30 days. In this short time they carry out their purpose, showing how everything has it's purpose in the web of life.. and speaking of that. </p>

<p> With great power.. comes great responsibility. Just like a fly, a spider holds it too, but they're much 'cooler'. Spiders have a large amount of habitats and variations. The most common, 'funnel' web spiders have all the iconic traits expected of a spider with 8 legs, 8 eyes, and the ability to produce intricate patterns of silk to catch prey. Spiders are natual pest control, their webs catching flies easier than anything else in nature. They also maintain air and water quality in eco systems by trapping airborne particles. EX: Pollen and Pollutants </p>
